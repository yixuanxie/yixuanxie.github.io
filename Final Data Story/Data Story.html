      Enrollment of new or first-time international student in U.S. fell by 6.6 percent in academic year 2017-18 compared to the year before, according to new data from the Institute of International Education’s (IIE) annual Open Doors survey.

      Among a range of factors reported driving the decline, visa delays or denials, cost of tuition and fees at U.S. host institution, and physical safety in the U.S. are among top ones, according to Rajika Bhandari, a senior adviser for research and strategy and director of the Center for Academic Mobility Research & Impact at the IIE.

    <h3>
      Visa Restrictions
    </h3>

    <p>
      President Donald Trump has been making it increasingly difficult for foreign students to study in the U.S. by implementing much stricter review of student visas and heightening anti-immigration rhetoric.
    </p>

    </p>
      As a result, the State Department issued less than 400,000 student visas in fiscal year 2017, which is a 17 percent decline from 2016 and a 40 percent drop from 2015.
    </p>

    <div class="infogram-embed" data-id="f6b8c7d5-6eb3-460a-b734-5f276dcffba7" data-type="interactive" data-title="visa issued"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>

    <h3>
      High Cost of U.S. Higher Education
    </h3>

    </p>
      In addition to restrictive visa policies, tuition cost is another reason why the U.S. became less attractive to international students.
    </p>

    </p>
      Over the past 8 years, costs for in-state students increased 15.9 percent at public two-year colleges, 16.3 percent at public four-year institutions, and 15.6 percent in the private nonprofit four-year sector, according to data from the College Board.
    </p>

    </p>
      The constant tuition increase hit international students harder. According to National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, a typical foreign student who attended an American college paid more than three times tuition and fees than a U.S. citizen in 2016.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Rise in Gun Violence
    </h3>

    </p>
      Excluding suicides, 15,651 people were killed by guns in the U.S. in 2017, according to data collected by Gun Violence Archive (GVA), marking a 3.6 percent increase compared to 2016. The number of people injured in gun-related violence grew by 2.01 percent as well, reaching to 31,259.
    </p>

    </p>
      “I do feel unsafe at times,” said Pooja Surana, a 36-year-old Indian student at the University of Chicago. “Thinking about such things, listening about such things and reading about such things,
    especially looking at videos, make me feel really bad, and may deter other international students from coming to the U.S. as well.”
