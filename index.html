    <p>
      Enrollment of new or first-time international students in the U.S. fell by 6.6 percent in academic year 2017-18 compared to the year before, according to new data from the annual Open Doors survey conducted by the Institute of International Education (IIE).

      Among a range of factors reported driving the decline, visa delays or denials, cost of tuition and fees at the U.S. host institution, and physical safety are among top ones, according to Rajika Bhandari, a senior adviser for research and strategy and director of the Center for Academic Mobility Research & Impact at the IIE.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Visa Restrictions
    </h3>

    <p>
      Since taking office, President Donald Trump has been making it increasingly difficult for foreign students to study in the U.S. by implementing much stricter review of student visas and heightening anti-immigration rhetoric.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, the State Department issued less than 400,000 student visas in fiscal year 2017, which is a 17 percent decline from 2016 and a 40 percent drop from 2015.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Cost of U.S. Higher Education
    </h3>

    <p>
      In addition to restrictive visa policies, tuition cost is another reason why the U.S. became less attractive to international students.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to OECD’s Education at a Glance 2017 report, charging $8,202 a year at bachelor level, the U.S. was named as having the highest average annual tuition fees worldwide.
    </p>

    <div class="infogram-embed" data-id="77784db8-292f-452a-bb77-d4e89eb025f7" data-type="interactive" data-title="Average Annual Tuition Fees of Countries Worldwide"></div><script>!function(e,t,s,i){var n="InfogramEmbeds",o=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],d=/^http:/.test(e.location)?"http:":"https:";if(/^\/{2}/.test(i)&&(i=d+i),window[n]&&window[n].initialized)window[n].process&&window[n].process();else if(!e.getElementById(s)){var r=e.createElement("script");r.async=1,r.id=s,r.src=i,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,0,"infogram-async","https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>

    <p>
      Despite the tuition fees which are already high, the cost of studying in the U.S. keeps increasing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dinesh Banda, a 28-year-old Indian MBA student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said his tuition has increased roughly 2 percent in the last year.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Obviously, it is difficult,” said Banda.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a greater increase in tuition fees at Northwestern University, another college in Illinois.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zhaoxun Yang, a Chinese graduate student at Northwestern University McCormick School of Engineering, said her tuition has increased by 3.6 percent, from $17,413 per quarter in academic year 2017-18 to $18,040 quarterly for academic year 2018-19.
    </p>

    <p>
      "It is crazy that the tuition fees are raising every year when it is already stressful for many international students to make ends meet," said Aoming Jin, a 26-year-old Chinese student at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "Increasing number of people have to give up the opportunities of studying in the U.S. since they can't afford."
    </p>

    <h3>
      Rise in Gun Violence
    </h3>

    <p>
      Safety issues troubled international applicants as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Excluding suicides, 15,651 people were killed by guns in the U.S. in 2017, according to data collected by Gun Violence Archive (GVA), marking a 3.6 percent increase compared to 2016. The number of people injured in gun-related violence grew by 2.01 percent as well, reaching to 31,259.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I do feel unsafe at times,” said Pooja Surana, a 36-year-old Indian MBA student at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “Thinking about such things, listening about such things and reading about such things,
    especially looking at videos, make me feel really bad, and may deter other international students from coming to the U.S. as well.”
